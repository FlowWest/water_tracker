Sacramento River Runoff is the sum of unimpaired flow in million acre-feet at: 
     Sacramento River above Bend Bridge
     Feather River at Oroville (aka inflow to Lake Oroville)
     Yuba River near Smartville
     American River below Folsom Lake

Also known as the "Sacramento River Index", this index was previously used
  to determine year type classifications under SWRCB Decision 1485.
  Also previously referred to as the "4 River Index" or "4 Basin Index".

     2020 (current year) =   6.6 MAF        50% of average
     2019 (last year) =     17.8 MAF       136% of average

     Sacramento River above Bend Bridge  
     Feather River at Oroville (aka inflow to Lake Oroville)
     Yuba River near Smartville
     American River below Folsom Lake
(2)  Maximum 10.0 for previous year index term

Previous Water Year Indices:
     2019 =                 10.3       129% of average
     1977 (Min) =            3.1        39% of average

     1966-2015 average =     8.0

Year Type Classification:     Index based on flow in million acre-feet:
     Wet                      Equal to or greater than 9.2
     Above Normal             Greater than 7.8, and less than 9.2
     Below Normal             Greater than 6.5, and equal to or less than 7.8
     Dry                      Greater than 5.4, and equal to or less than 6.5
     Critical                 Equal to or less than 5.4

This index, originally specified in the 1995 SWRCB Water Quality Control Plan,
   is used to determine the Sacramento Valley water year type as implemented in
   SWRCB D-1641.  Year types are set by first of month forecasts beginning in 
   February.  Final determination is based on the May 1  50% exceedence forecast.

SACRAMENTO VALLEY & SAN JOAQUIN 8 RIVER INDEX
     Previous month:                     Apr      2500 TAF

This index is the sum of the previous month's unimpaired runoff for the 8 rivers
   that are included in the above SACRAMENTO RIVER UNIMPAIRED RUNOFF
   and the SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY WATER YEAR TYPE INDEX

A listing of reconstructed indices based on historical observed runoff is posted
   at http://cdec.water.ca.gov/water_supply.html
The official year types are based on May 1 forecasts, not the observed runoff.
